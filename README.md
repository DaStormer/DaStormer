**»»» *Founder of Storm Developmentz***  
I am the Founder of [Storm Developmentz](https://stormdevelopmentz.xyz/home), a Discord bots development team. We are focused on providing servers with efficient, reliable, and top quality bots that meet their purposes. We pride ourselves on developing unique features that are not commonly found in public bots.  

Our first public project is [StormBeatz](https://stormbeatz.org/), an advanced and highly customizable Discord music bot that will liven up your music and ensure you have enough settings to be in control. It's currently serving 10800+ servers and 1.5M+ users.

I'm currently an administrator for CyberHeist, an upcoming open-world and futuristic Roblox game.  
I oversee and manage the Discord server/community. I'm also tasked with the development of moderation utilities and other systems.  

**»»» *Developer for BA/MUT***  
I am currently a developer for [BACON ARMY](https://discord.gg/myusernamesthis), the official Discord server of [MyUsernamesThis](https://www.youtube.com/myusernamesthis).  
My job is to develop, manage, and maintain Discord bots that aid in server operations, ranging from state of the art moderation, automating ban appeals, and other systems. 

**»»» *Abracadabra Head Moderator & Bot Developer***  
I'm currently a Head Moderator of Abracadabra, a Roblox development group that created SharkBite and Backpacking.

I just released my own node module, [starify-discord](https://www.npmjs.com/package/starify-discord, 'starify-discord npmjs.com'). Starify-discord is a node.js module to easily create and manage starboards using discord.js!  It's my first node module and open source project. If you notice any bugs, feel free to open an issue on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DaStormer/starify-discord, 'GitHub repository for starify-discord').
